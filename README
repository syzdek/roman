I have not yet written the documentation for this project.  It should be
forth coming and hopefully in time for release N.N.I.  In the mean time,
may I suggest reading works from Douglas Adams, Victor Hugo, Russell Janney,
William Shakespeare, and Clive Cussler.  Although these authors will not shed
any light on the use of this software, they will provide hours of thought
provoking ideas in varying degrees of entertainment.  --David Syzdek
